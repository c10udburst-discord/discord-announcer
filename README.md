## discord-announcer

Basically [announcement channels](https://support.discord.com/hc/articles/360032008192-), but for any text channel.

This requires client token. This can be concidered self-botting and can get your account banned.

### Setup
- clone repo
- optionally create venv
- install requirements
- create `config.json` (you can look into config.example.json to see how it is supposed to look)
