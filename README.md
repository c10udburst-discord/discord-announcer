## discord-announcer

Basically [announcement channels](https://support.discord.com/hc/articles/360032008192-), but for any text channel.

This requires client token. This can be concidered self-botting and can get your account banned.

### Setup
- `git clone https://github.com/c10udburst-discord/discord-announcer.git`
- create `config.json` (you can look at `config.example.json` look into [config.example.json](https://github.com/c10udburst-discord/discord-announcer/blob/master/config.example.json) to see how it should look)
- optionally set up [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)
- install requirements, by running `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
- run `main.py`
